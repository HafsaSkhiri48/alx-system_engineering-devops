A bash script is a series of commands written in a file. These are read and executed by the bash program. The program executes line by line.

For example, you can navigate to a certain path, create a folder and spawn a process inside it using the command line.

You can do the same sequence of steps by saving the commands in a bash script and running it. You can run the script any number of times.
